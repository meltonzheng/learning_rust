Project 1: Building browser-based MMORPG like [what this YouTuber did](https://github.com/meltonzheng/Quick_3D_MMORPG)
- There's [a simple web app](http://joelmccracken.github.io/entries/a-simple-web-app-in-rust-pt-1/) I can steal
- I basically have the code for both
- ok whatever let's just go [-->](./webserver/README.md)

Project 2: Theory testing basic computation from [Crash Course Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpnE6UAfbtU)
- Interesting proof of concept... like can I build rust with rust?
